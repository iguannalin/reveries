## Poem 1

You will know her presence in the half-light,<br>
New flowers upon her yellow head;<br>
Swift as the night and full with the night,<br>
She'll put the water true.
<br>
Making all men as the sea to sea-<br>
She, the signal to my oxygen;<br>
High in the haze of the ecstasy,<br>
Encircle me, and take this hour.
<br>
Succor in the dark,<br>
be sun in the<br>
dark


## Poem 2

You who were there<br>
and are gone have come back.<br>
Rose the sun like a subtle turbid night;<br>
The water fell asleep in water warm,<br>
Sharing the fire of my first impulse;<br>
Divulge this secrets of that upper heart,<br>
You had to catch me in the public way.<br>
Light as a figure on a single way,<br>
Pastures that walked alone against the ice<br>
Beside the moon tints of purple and pearl,<br>
Hold her own power in a world of pride!


## Poem 3

I write you<br>
my tongue mangled on your<br>
A moon was in the convent that flew<br>
Rose the wild starry flame on every shore.<br>

When I beheld her face,<br>
She smiled again her wistful sadness, and that night<br>
Exposed with tender troth, and her disgrace<br>
Lay me in your humble might.<br>

Blue as a lo√®r lip<br>
Saw the wild eye, the rustic gay,<br>
Doth I of my feel ship,<br>
Soon would she wait on me that day.
